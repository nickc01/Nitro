# Nitro

Nitro is a powerup system that makes it easy to implement different kinds of powerups for your game.

It not only includes the ability to build regular powerups and combinable powerups, but it also provides several tools and components to make it easier to integrate powerups into your game system, such as:

- **Nitro Variables** | A special kind of variable that can easily be modified and reverted, making it easier to have stats that are changed temporarily when a powerup is collected
- **Collidable** : A component that makes it easy for keeping track of object that collide with it
- **Collectors** : Components that make it easy for collecting, storing and executing powerups.
